review: Nice sight I like the reverse card layout. Your job pages are actually well structered aswell. Making the skills needed and have as tags is a nice touch aswell. The video and sound on hover is really cool aswell!!!ðŸ¥µ You have some missing images but that can be easily remedied. Other than that gj!
